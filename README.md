## Compiled information derived from books that I have read and personal research. Keeping knowledge accessible to the community...

Feel free to share the info (no credit needed), update the repo and contribute...

The guides are made as abstract as possible though giving the edge of the rope so you can start pulling for the details.

### USE THE INTERNET AS IT WAS DESIGED TO BE AND NOT FOR SELLING YOURSELF FOR FREE ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA...

### General:

Knowledge is power, the internet has revolutionised the way knowledge is distributed. Use it...
Try reading as much as you can, the rule of thumb is 1 book each week, although there are days that I read 600 pages.
Share the knowledge, you probably recieved it also for free.
Search for a mentor, if you think you have enough knowledge though search for a mentee.
