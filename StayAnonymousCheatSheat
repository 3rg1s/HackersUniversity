Passwords:
Passphrase must:
  1.Be 20+ characters long.
  2.Not contain dictionary words.
  3.Not be a l33t sp34k or any other encoded dictionary word.
  4.Not be a derivative of another password you have already used.
  5.Or creation procedure must be memorized and never be written.
  6.Must never be reused.
  
  7.Use 2 factor authentication where available
  8.You may be forced to tell your password,
    to prevent this make a password creation routine so that the actual password is impossible to remember.
    Remember the procedure to recreate your password.
  
Communication:
   1.Use anonymous email servers like protonmail, tutanota, tormail.
   2.Encrypt your communication (for instace PGP) and share the keys on an alternative data stream (disposable usb key).
   3.Encrypt like everybody is watching (believe me, they are...).
   4.Never use the same devices you use in your everyday life for an undercover job.
