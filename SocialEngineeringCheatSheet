THIS GUIDE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOUSES ONLY!
This article is a synopsis of kevin mitnicks book "The art of deception" with extra personal research.

Basics
Human behaviour can be exploited by leveraging the following:
  1.Authority, posing as a superior.
  2.Liking, make the victim like you (same interests,hobbies,attraction).
  3.Reciprocation, give something small, ask something bigger in return,
   pose as a helper or make the victim need you, promise a gift.
  4.Consistency, exploit publicl promises made by a victim.
  5.Social validation, make sure your proposal seems to be publicly acceptable,
   as if everyone would comply to the thing you are asking.
  6.Scarcity, promise something (free smartphone) that only the first N people will get
   if i.e they register on a site and exploit the password reuse principle.
  7.Habit, if it is someones work to provide a certain seemingly information on a daily basis,
    you can bet that his resistance will be lower if you ask the same information that happens
    to be interesting for you.
  8.Greed, nothing to add here...
 
 Remediation is left out on purpouse to keep the tides even....
